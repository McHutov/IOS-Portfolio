## Checklist
[Buoywatch](https://github.com/McHutov/iOS-Portfolio/tree/master/iOS-Projects/Cheaklists) is an iOS & Apple Watch app made using **SwiftUI** and **Combine** as I've been playing around with the latest Apple frameworks since day one after the WWDC.
It allows you to get real-time marine buoys data and get aware when the surf is good at a glance.
Too often swell arrives later than predicted, by checking the buoy data you can determine if the swell has arrived. If not, you can go back to bed =)

##### 🔨Technologies: SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM, Bitrise, Notifications, No third party libraries.
##### 🚀Platform: 📱iOS, ⌚️watchOS
